          <h1>Standard Health Record</h1>

          <p><a href="http://standardhealthrecord.org">The Standard Health Record Collaborative</a> is working to create the Standard Health Record (SHR), a single, high-quality health record for every individual in the United States. The SHR provides the foundation for the collection, communication, and aggregation of patient data, into one accurate, timely, precise, relevant, and complete record. SHR will  accelerate secondary uses in public health, disease surveillance, post-approval monitoring, and patient-centered outcomes research. By establishing a single target for health data, the SHR can solve clinical interoperability and support a wide-range of clinicians, caregivers and healthcare providers. </p>
          <p> Enabling transparency and precise communication across the healthcare system, the SHR leads clinicians and the American public to realize major benefits through improved care coordination, reduction of medical errors, minimization of waste, fraud, and abuse, and decreased costs that accompany healthier lives.</p>

          <p>  Currently, SHR provides standards for recording information about:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Actors who play a role in the health space</li>
            <li>Immunization history of patients</li>
            <li>Human behaviors that impact present and future health (e.g. SmokingStatus and ContraceptiveMethodsUsed)</li>
            <li>Patient demographics </li>
            <li>Environmental factors that impact patient health and treatment access</li>
            <li>Life histories of patients, reflecting any changes over time</li>
            <li>Medications, highlighting treatment specific details and medication adherence </li>
            <li>Vital sign metrics crucial to emergency and in-patient treatment (e.g. DiastolicPressure and OxygenSaturation)</li>
          </ul>

          <p> As an open source project, the SHR engages a broad community and can provide a powerful model for global health. <strong>To contribute</strong>, please visit the Standard Health Record Collaborative on <a href="https://github.com/standardhealth">Github</a>. Additionally, in the spirit of engaging the open source community, we maintain a <a href="https://lightmyfhir.org">blog</a> where we share posts on topics in data modeling, our experience with FHIR, and other healthcare topics.

          <p>The goal of
            <a href="http://icaredata.org/">the ICAREdata Project</a> is to support the collection of high-quality real-world data, that is complete, accurate,
            and computable, in a way that enables clinical oncology research.
          </p>
    
          <p>Establishing a large scale, prospective collection and integration of high quality clinical data across multiple clinical
            care sites would increase the available data to include both data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and high-quality
            real-world data (RWD). This approach would also allow development of effective treatment strategies for cohorts of
            patients that are not amenable to study in RCTs such as rare tumors or uncommon disease types, as well as allow an
            understanding of the natural history and response to therapy for diseases where multiple sequential therapeutic regimens
            are employed. Additionally, our goal is to inform regulatory decision making by helping to determine how to best
            use real-world evidence for medical product regulatory decision-making and achieving efficient and accurate post-market
            surveillance of FDA-approved therapeutics. Lastly, this will inform data driven patient care by understanding the
            efficacy and safety of approved therapeutic agents in underrepresented and minority populations and accumulating
            a large number of patients and data required to achieve success in personalized medicine.

          <h1>About the team behind Standard Health Record Collaborative</h1>

          <p>
            <a href="http://www.mitre.org">The MITRE Corporation</a> is a not-for-profit company working in the public interest, operating multiple federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). FFRDCs are unique organizations that assist the United States government with scientific research and analysis, development and acquisition, and systems engineering and integration. MITRE does not have commercial interests and cannot compete for anything except the right to operate FFRDCs. This lack of commercial conflicts of interest forms the basis for MITRE’s objectivity and subsequent ability to acquire sensitive and proprietary information from the government and industry to inform critical initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH) FFRDC, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), assists both the CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in performing research and analysis on various topics that fall within the national health domain. As the CAMH FFRDC operator and partner, MITRE serves as an objective, independent advisor to CMS and HHS operating divisions. As the only broadly healthcare-focused FFRDC, CAMH supports many of the complex analysis and critical thinking requirements that encompass the business, policy, technology, and operational interests across CMS and HHS.
